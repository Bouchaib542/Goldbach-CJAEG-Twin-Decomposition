      The CJAEG method (Conjecture des Jumeaux Anti-Équidistants de Goldbach) is a novel mathematical approach
      to decomposing any even number <strong>E</strong> into a pair of prime numbers (p, q) such that:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>E = A + B is a partition of E</li>
      <li>p = A ± s and q = B ∓ s for some integer s</li>
      <li>At least one of p or q is part of a twin prime pair</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This hypothesis expands the traditional GPS method by using <strong>anti-equidistant structures</strong>
      and twin prime configurations to explain the persistent validity of Goldbach's Conjecture for extremely large even numbers.
