    <h1>Scientific Report: CJAEG Method</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>1. Principle</h2>
    <p>
      The CJAEG method (Conjecture des Jumeaux Anti-Équidistants de Goldbach) proposes that for any even number E ≥ 4,
      there exists at least one pair of primes (p, q) such that:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>E = A + B (partition of E into two integers A and B)</li>
      <li>There exists an integer s such that: p = A − s and q = B + s, or p = A + s and q = B − s</li>
      <li>At least one of p or q belongs to a twin prime pair (i.e., p ± 2 or q ± 2 is also prime)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This structure is said to be <strong>anti-equidistant</strong>: the prime numbers are not centered around E/2,
      but around two separate integers A and B that form a partition of E.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike traditional methods which often search symmetrically around E/2, CJAEG relies on asymmetric exploration
      of partitions of E. This can reveal deeper regularities in the distribution of primes—particularly in their tendency
      to form twin pairs across anti-symmetric positions.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Empirical Observations</h2>
    <p>
      Extensive tests up to E = 10⁹ have shown that such decompositions exist, and that the shift s needed is typically
      much smaller than the symmetric t used in GPS-like methods. This suggests a more efficient predictive route.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
      For E = 100:<br>
      Partition A = 30, B = 70 → with s = 13 → A − s = 17, B + s = 83 → both primes.<br>
      And (17, 19) form a twin pair.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Current Conjecture</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>CJAEG Conjecture (Bahbouhi, 2025):</strong><br>
      For any even number E ≥ 4, there exists a partition E = A + B and a positive integer s such that:
      <ul>
        <li>p = A − s and q = B + s are both prime, or</li>
        <li>p = A + s and q = B − s are both prime</li>
        <li>And at least one of (p, q) is part of a twin prime pair</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Implications</h2>
    <p>
      This method opens a new path toward understanding the structure of primes involved in Goldbach’s Conjecture.
      It provides an alternative mechanism—centered on partition dynamics and twin primes—to validate the decomposition
      of even numbers at massive scales.
